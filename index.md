### Background
As a first-generation college student, I studied Computer Engineering at the University of California Santa Cruz. Throughout my undergraduate career, my engagement in computer networks, computer systems, and programming courses allowed me to build a strong foundation of network architectures and protocols, system design principles, and C & C++.

### Professional & Academic Role
During my time as an undergraduate, I worked as a BSOE lab tutor for [CS12/L](https://courses.soe.ucsc.edu/courses/cse12){:target="_blank"}. Currently, I am looking for an apprenticeship or an internship in the areas of Information Technology, Security, and Software Engineering to learn more about how concepts of computer networks, systems, and programming are applied to real-world applications.

### Research Interests
Moving forward with my graduate career, I aim to pursue research that incorporates topics of Security in Computer Networks and Systems to learn more about upcoming developments and to aid me in building solutions to security challenges.

### Hobbies & Interests
Outside of the computer screen, I enjoy road biking, traveling to new places, trying new foods, and cooking with friends!
